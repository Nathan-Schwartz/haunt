GITHUB BOT
==========

### The problem

Large projects have 1000's of users with only a handful of maintainers.

Maintainers are often involved in several projects, and their time is very valuable and therefore shouldn't be wasted trying to interpret inconsistent or incomplete github issues.

### The solution

A bot which validates github issues for relevance and completeness - closing invalid tickets and tagging and organizing valid tickets.

This bot should educate users on the correct way to file issues (including pull requests) for a given project.

#### Invalid Issues

If an issue fails to validate a provided set of tests (default tests based on [necolas's issue guidelines](https://github.com/necolas/issue-guidelines)), then an explicit error message is added to the ticket, the ticket is closed, and optionally a link to the issue filing guidelines is provided.

#### Valid Issues

Valid issues are tagged and assigned to relevant authors based on a set of simple assertion tests.

#### .botrc

a json spec which includes path to tests and path to issue filing readme.
